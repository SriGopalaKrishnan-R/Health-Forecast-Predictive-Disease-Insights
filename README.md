# Health-Forecast-Predictive-Disease-Insights
To create a disease predictor model that gives us the possibility of disease to be occurred based on the symptoms given by the user.
This project aims to predict diseases based on patient symptoms using various machine learning techniques. It simplifies the diagnosis process, providing an early detection tool to potentially save lives.

## Implementation

  ### Data Preprocessing
  - **Loading Data**: Data is loaded from the UCI repository.
  - **Cleaning**: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing data.
  - **Feature Selection**: Using backward modeling and p-value tests to select relevant features.
  
  ### Model Training
  - **Algorithms Used**:
    - Logistic Regression
    - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
    - Na√Øve Bayes
    - Decision Tree Classifier
    - Random Forest Classifier
    - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
    - 
  - **Training**: Each model is trained on the preprocessed dataset.
  - **Evaluation**: Models are evaluated using metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall and F1-Score.

  ### Prediction
  - **User Input**: Symptoms are input by the user.
  - **Prediction**: The trained model predicts the disease based on the input symptoms.
  - **Output**: The system outputs the predicted disease along with the probability.

## Tech Stack
- **Programming Language**: Python 3.1
- **Libraries**:
  - `numpy`
  - `pandas`
  - `scikit-learn`
  - `matplotlib`
